# Sentiment-Analysis-with-TF-IDF
🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis pipeline that classifies textual data into positive or negative sentiment using TF-IDF feature extraction and machine learning algorithms.

🔹 Dataset

Text-based dataset containing labeled sentiment data

Labels: Positive / Negative

Data cleaned and preprocessed before model training

🔹 Technologies & Tools

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Workflow

Data loading and exploratory analysis

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Model training using multiple ML algorithms

Performance evaluation and comparison

Visualization of results and feature importance

🔹 Models Used

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🔹 Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

🔹 Results

Logistic Regression achieved the best balance between precision and recall

TF-IDF helped capture important textual patterns efficiently

Model generalizes well to unseen text samples

🔹 Key Learnings

Importance of text preprocessing in NLP pipelines

Why accuracy alone is insufficient for text classification

How TF-IDF converts unstructured text into meaningful numerical features
